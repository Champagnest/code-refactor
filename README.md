#code refactor

The goal behind this assignment was to rework the coding and get the website ready and deploy it. 

In this project I added HTML elements, CSS and HTML notes, condensed and rewrote some CSS and added images to the website. I learned how to better optimize HTML and CSS. 

Description
Very simple yet functional website adversiting marketing and management services. Has pictures, text, and a working navigation bar. I faced some challenges with giving my HTML the correct elements in the right places.
